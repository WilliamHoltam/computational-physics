WRITE(6,*) "This program finds the roots of a cubic function using the Newton-Raphson method,"
WRITE(6,*) " "
WRITE(6,*) "i.e. it finds all possible values of x which satisfy the equation: f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0."

!I had to change this so that the coeficients are defined individually. Then I an input them into the cubic equation.

WRITE(6,*) "Please input a value for a."
READ(5,*) a
WRITE(6,*) " "
WRITE(6,*) "Please input a value for b."
READ(5,*) b
WRITE(6,*) " "
WRITE(6,*) "Please input a value for c."
READ(5,*) c
WRITE(6,*) " "
WRITE(6,*) "Please input a value for d."
READ(5,*) d
WRITE(6,*) " "
WRITE(6,*) " "
WRITE(6,*) "Make a guess as a first approximation to the root of the function (x); write down this value."
READ(5,*) x1
WRITE(6,*) " "

!'t' remains as the initial guess so that it can be referenced later

t=x1
x=x1

!This is a do loop which uses the formulat x1=x0-f(x0)/f'(x0) to find an estimate of a root of the cubic equation
